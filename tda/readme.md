# Bank Marketing Data Set

The data is related with direct marketing campaigns (phone calls) of a Portuguese banking institution. The classification goal is to predict if the client will subscribe a term deposit (variable y).

## Constructing distance matrix

We first onehot-encode the categorical variables. We remove the "call duration" variable, as it is not available at test time. Then we use K-means (via Scikit-learn) to create 50 clusters. For every sample in a cluster we create a 50-dimensional vector with the distances to all other clusters. We compute the 50-dimensional mean of each cluster member cluster distances. For every 50-dimensional cluster mean we compute Euclidean distance to every other 50-dimensional cluster mean. This is our distance matrix.

## Constructing tree

We use version 1.0.8 of the maketree utility (via CompLearn). This algorithm uses Markov-Chain Monte-Carlo to optimize the Minimum Quartet Tree Cost. We obtain a tree with a fitness of ~0.998, exported as a .dot file.

We write a small parser for Python to run through the .dotfile and output a tree with D3.js and HTML5.

## Data-driven

To use the tree to aid a data-driven approach/exploration, we color the nodes by their signal ratio. This allows us to identify clusters/nodes with a high, or low, signal ratio. It also visually tells us if the constructed tree is informative.

We also look at the mean of a variables in a cluster vs. the mean of a variable in the entire dataset. If this is 1, 2, 3 standard deviation above or below the dataset mean, we show this inside a tooltip.

From the tree we can get a few quick insights:

- Older customers subscribe a term deposit more often
- Retired customers subscribe more often
- When poutcome=success is above average customers subscribe more often
- When Month=aug, sep, oct, mar, apr, dec is above average customers subscribe more often
- Low Euribor3m customers subscribe more often
- Low pdays customers subscribe more often
- High "campaign" customers subscribe less often
- Low "contact=cellular" customers subscribe less often
- Younger customers subscribe to a term deposit less often
